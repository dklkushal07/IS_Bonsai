                <p>The HTML code displays a section about the values of a company. The section has a header "Our Values" and consists of four value statements, each displayed in a separate container.<br>
                    This HTML code showcases a section featuring 5 team members. Each member has a profile picture,
                    name, job title, and links to their social media profiles. When a profile picture is clicked, both a "popup" function and a unique function (e.g. click1(), click2(), etc.) are triggered.<br> 
                    The code you provided creates a CV container with two modals. The first modal contains the following details: name, contact (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub), skills (soft skills, technical skills), profile, educational background, volunteering, and certifications.
                <br>
                The code creates a feedback form with inputs for name, email and feedback text. The form consists of a text input for name, an email input for email, and a textarea input for feedback. The form also includes a submit button with the label "Submit". The form inputs have the "required" attribute to make them mandatory for submitting the form.</p>
