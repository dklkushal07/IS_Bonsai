            <div class="value">

                <p>
                    1. The reference page and the blog page both use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and style their webpages
                    <br>
                        <p><b>Gohyer:</b></p>

                    <img src="../images/research_blog.png" style="height: 30%; width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="../images/research_blog1.png" style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; height: 70%; width: 70%; margin-left: 7rem;">

                    <img src="../images/research_login1.png" style="height: 30%; width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Both pages have a header section at the top, which is usually the first thing a user sees when they visit the 
                    website. The header section usually contains the logo and the main navigation menu.
                    <br>
                        <p><b>Gohyer:</b></p>
        
                    <img src="../images/research_blog2.png" style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; height: 70%; width: 70%; margin-left: 7rem;">
                    <p><b>Shrubs:</b></p>
                    <img src="../images/research_login1.png" style="height: 30%; width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    <img src="../images/research_login2.png" style="height: 30%; width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Both pages also use CSS for styling, including for defining the layout, font styles, and colors used on the page.
                    <br>
                        <p><b>Gohyer:</b></p>

                    <img src="../images/research_blog.png" style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; height: 70%; width: 70%; margin-left: 7rem;">
                    <img src="../images/research_blog1.png" style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; height: 70%; width: 70%; margin-left: 7rem;">
                    <p><b>Shrubs:</b></p>
                    <img src="../images/research_login1.png" style="height: 30%; width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="value">
                <h1 id="value4">DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PAGES</h1>
                <p>
                    1. The reference blog page contains various links that lead to different pages in different categories whereas 
                    the blog page only consists of a singular page.
                    <br>
                        <p><b>Daily Harvest:</b></p>

                    <img src="../images/research_blog3.png" style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; height: 70%; width: 70%; margin-left: 7rem;">
                    <p><b>Shrubs:</b></p>

                    </video>
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The blog page does not contain complex styling elements in order to portrays a minimalistic approach. The reference page on the other hand 
                    contains sophisticated designs with additional elements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Daily Harvest:</b></p>
                    <img src="../images/research_blog.png" style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px; height: 70%; width: 70%; margin-left: 7rem;">

                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    3. The blog page only static text, while the Daily Harvest blog page has dynamic content that changes based on user
                     interactions, updates to the website, or other factors.
